This repository contains the PCB design files, firmware, and software for the O-Scope, which is a low-cost (i.e., a cut-tape BoM cost of about $30 
as of fall 2020) two-channel oscilloscope / single-channel waveform generator up to a bandwidth of 200 kHz that fits into a solderless breadboard.  
The oscilloscope's vertical resolution is 12 bits and each channel is sampled at 4 MS/s.  Each channel has a sample buffer of 1,500 points.  The 
oscilloscope probes are differential and have an equivalent input impedance of 1 MΩ || 15 pF with two input voltage ranges: ±10V and ±2V.  The 
waveform generator is capable of producing DC, sinusoidal, square, and triangle waves with an adjustable offset in the range of 0 - 5V. For an overview 
and demonstration of the O-Scope, see https://youtu.be/0cz0oYtfNsY.

I designed this instrument during the summer of 2020 based on a prior prototype that I had made during the summers of 2016 and 2017 in order to support 
a remote / hybrid offering of ENGR 1125: Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement at Olin College during the spring 2021 in the midst 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During October and November 2020, I hand assembled and calibrated 90 O-Scopes at home, as shown in https://youtu.be/zYawotioLMc.  We have used these instruments during the spring 2021 and spring 2022 offerings of the course at Olin.
